# ADT-momo-multilingual
Test of the Momo ADT with 13 languages

This is an example of an ADT generated from a Grade 1 Bhutanese book used in school called "Momo and the Leopards".

A PDF was placed into the ADT-AI Pipeline, and 10 mins later a fully functional accessible version of the book is produced.

Note: 
The voice model for English is OpenAI, however for other languages we use Azure-TTS. 

The easy-read mode and eli5 mode make more sense in more challenging texts where the vocabulary isn't as simple.
